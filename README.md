# Little Lemon Restaurant App

This is the capstone project of iOS development certificate courses by Meta.

In the design planning phase, I utilised Figma. To ensure the workflow, I employed Git and GitHub.

Initially, I focused on developing the onboarding flow, which allows users to create their accounts. Subsequently, I worked on establishing the navigation flow. Next, using Core Data, I implemented data fetching from an API and local storage on a mobile device. This approach enables users to interact with the application even without internet connectivity.

Furthermore, I enhanced the application by implementing sorting and filtering functionalities for food items. While this introduced additional complexity, it simplified the user experience.
